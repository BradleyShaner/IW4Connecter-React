Originally, the bulk of the code was created by (I believe) NTAuthority.
I worked on this years ago, so I can't be certain how I came to have it.
If I had to guess, I probably decompiled an aIW release, got it compilable, and changed it to suit my needs.

This was used in conjuction with my LanLauncher that made playing MW2 on LAN super easy, but it's no longer useful.

I have another project that uses some features of this program to send commands to MW2 in order to do things like change server variables, load mods, change maps, etc.

I'll hopefully get around to updating that in the near future and release it :)
